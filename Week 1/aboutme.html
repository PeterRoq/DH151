    <hr>
    <h2>But first, let me introduce myself.</h2>
    <p>My name is Peter Roquemore and here's my portrait</p>

    <p>Here are just a few of the lies I may tell you</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Did you know that I have <b>only</b> 82 teeth?</li>
            <!-- A picture of 82 teeth? -->
            <ol> <li><img src="images/toothfairy.png" width="300px"></li>
                
            </ol>
        <li>Would you <i>believe</i> me if I said that one time I was a pig?</li>
        <ol> <li><img src="images/pigboy.jpg" width="300px"></li>
       </ol>
        
        <li>What about if I told you I was once in love with a rock?</li> 
        <ol> <li><img src="images/pigrock.jpg" width="300px"></li>
       </ol>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, those would all be lies and if you believed me then you are a fool.</p>
